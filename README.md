# Khalas Flip Page Glider
The Page Glider is an automatic reader designed to assist the disabled, older readers, and institutions that seek to enhance accessibility. It provides a hands-free reading experience that benefits users with mobility impairments, dexterity limitations, arthritis, and neurological disorders such as Parkinson's. As the market for assistive technology is worth $25 billion in 2020 and increasing by 7.5% annually through 2026, there is a clear requirement for solutions offering independent reading capabilities. Additionally, 65% of Americans read books more than digital counterparts, further validating the need for an accessible page turner. While existing products like the PageFlip Firefly and Viking Easy Turn are addressing some of the needs for accessibility, they are not affordable or fully automated. The Page Glider is going to bridge this gap with its cost-effectively priced, flexible, and user-friendly innovation that enhances the reading experience for different users.
